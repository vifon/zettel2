;;; Commentary:

;; Custom org-mode links for zettel2 that only reference the note ID.
;; This way the file can be freely renamed without breaking the link.
;;
;; The links are displayed with a distinct prefix
;; (`zettel2-link-text-prefix') to make the internal links immediately
;; obviously different from the external ones.
;;
;; To create a link use the "zettel:" prefix when creating a link with
;; `org-insert-link' (C-c C-l).

;;; FAQ:

;; - Q: Why not use the "id:" links available in the vanilla org-mode?
;;
;;   A: In their case, if a file gets renamed org-mode rescans
;;      a specific set of files for the missing file, essentially
;;      rebuilding its ID database.  It works but a given directory
;;      needs to be added to the list of directories to scan.
;;      The "zettel:" links never keep any database, so renaming is
;;      completely irrelevant to their operation, it's all business
;;      as usual.

;;; Code:

(require 'zettel2)

(require 'org)


(defgroup zettel2-link nil
  "The custom links within `zettel2-mode'."
  :group 'zettel2)

(defcustom zettel2-link-text-prefix "ยง "
  "A visual prefix for the internal links between notes."
  :type 'string)

(defun zettel2-link-follow (link &optional arg)
  (org-link-open-as-file (zettel2-get-note-by-id link) arg))

(defun zettel2-link-complete ()
  (concat
   "zettel:"
   (zettel2-file-id (completing-read "File: " (zettel2-all-notes)))))

(defun zettel2-link-export (path desc backend)
  (let* ((file (zettel2-get-note-by-id path))
         (file-base-name (file-name-sans-extension file)))
    ;; Loosely borrowed from Denote by Protesilaos Stavrou.
    (cond
     ((eq backend 'html) (format "<a href=\"%s.html\">%s</a>" file-base-name desc))
     ((eq backend 'latex) (format "\\href{%s}{%s}" (replace-regexp-in-string "[\\{}$%&_#~^]" "\\\\\\&" file) desc))
     ((eq backend 'texinfo) (format "@uref{%s,%s}" file desc))
     ((eq backend 'ascii) (format "[%s] <zettel:%s>" desc file))
     ((eq backend 'md) (format "[%s](%s.md)" desc file-base-name))
     (t (format "%s (%s)" desc file-base-name)))))

;;; XXX: Currently this displays a link prefix by replacing the hidden
;;; leading "[" character of the link with this prefix.  Apart from
;;; being a hack, it seems to persist during a mode change.  Right now
;;; it will suffice, but a better solution is needed.
